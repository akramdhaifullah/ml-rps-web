## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a total of 2520 images with an equal proportion of images per class: 840 images for rock, paper, and scissors, respectively.

### Data Preprocessing

## Deep Learning Model
The modelling involves training the dataset with a pre-trained MobileNet model. MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture that is trained on the ImageNet dataset consisting of millions of labeled images accross thousands of categories.
